# Lua Sandbox Library

## Overview

Sandboxes provide a dynamic and isolated execution environment
for data parsing, transformation, and analysis.  They allow access to data
without jeopardizing the integrity or performance of the processing
infrastructure. This broadens the audience that the data can be
exposed to and facilitates new uses of the data (i.e. debugging, monitoring,
dynamic provisioning,  SLA analysis, intrusion detection, ad-hoc reporting,
etc.)

The Lua sandbox is a library allowing customized control over the Lua execution
environment including functionality like global data preservation/restoration on
shutdown/startup, output collection in textual or binary formats and an array of
parsers for various data types (Nginx, Apache, Syslog, MySQL and many RFC grammars)

These libraries and utilities have been mostly extracted from
[Hindsight](https://github.com/mozilla-services/hindsight). The goal was to
decouple the Heka/Hindsight functionality from any particular infrastructure and
make it embeddable into any tool or language.

### Features

- small - memory requirements are as little as 8 KiB for a basic sandbox
- fast - microsecond execution times
- stateful - ability to resume where it left off after a restart/reboot
- isolated - failures are contained and malfunctioning sandboxes are terminated.
  Containment is defined in terms of restriction to the operating system,
  file system, libraries, memory use, Lua instruction use, and output size.

### CMake Build Instructions

    git clone https://github.com/mozilla-services/lua_sandbox.git
    cd lua_sandbox
    mkdir release
    cd release

    # UNIX

## Releases

* The main branch is the current release and is considered stable at all
  times.
* New versions can be released as frequently as every two weeks (our sprint
  cycle). The only exception would be for a high priority patch.
* All active work is flagged with the sprint milestone and tracked in the
  project dashboard.
* New releases occur the day after the sprint finishes.
  * The version in the dev branch is updated
  * The changes are merged into main
  * A new tag is created

## Contributions

* All pull requests must be made against the dev branch, direct commits to
  main are not permitted.
* All non trivial contributions should start with an issue being filed (if it is
  a new feature please propose your design/approach before doing any work as not
  all feature requests are accepted).
